I am a Software Developer and Data Scientist passionate about solving Africa's problems using Data. I excel at Exploratory Data Analysis, building and optimizing Machine Learning models and story telling using Data.
In my spare time, I enjoy discovering the best places to eat amala and gbegiri in my city.
